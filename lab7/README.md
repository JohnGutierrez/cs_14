Based on the graph shown, hash tables are more efficient than trees in inserting and 
locating elements. Although a hash table is much faster, it is not ordered.
On the other hand, while a self-balancing tree is slower but keeps elements in order.
The decision to use a hash table or a self-balancing tree depends on the user's
preference: runtime vs. organization.
